# Shopping Cart

## Description
Imagine there exists a shop that sells anything you want at a price that you can choose! I know, *totally* unrealistic but for this program, it __exists__! With this shopping cart application, users are able to add items, remove items, view the total cost, and checkout.

## Installation
You can fork a copy of the code in order to work on and amend it as you see fit.
